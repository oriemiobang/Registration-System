                                     REGISTRATION SYSTEM

This program focuses on registration system, specifically as an example of freshman student's of
haramaya university.
It has no GUI and no Database which means there is not graphical user interface so you just have to use the console and it is not connected to any database so every data you enter stays on and will be deleted once the program terminates.
For practice purpose it has two side the student and the admin side, the student can only register but the admin can login using a user name and a password the default password is:

                                     USERNAME: admin
                                     PASSWORD: admin

 all lowercase, once he is in he can register, display registered, update and even delete registered student. 
 In this Java mini project a lot of java concepts have been used things like: encapsulation, inheritance
 polimorphisim, throw exceptions, try and catch and a lot of concepts.
