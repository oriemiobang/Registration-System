                                     REGISTRATION SYSTEM

This program focuses on registration system, specifically as an example of freshman student's of
haramaya university.
It has no GUI and no Database which means there is no graphical user interface so you just have to use the console or the terminal and it is not connected to any database so every data you enter stays on the temporary memory and will be deleted once the program terminates.
It has two sides the student's and the admin's side, the student can only register but the admin can login using a user name and a password the default password and username is:

                                     USERNAME: admin
                                     PASSWORD: admin

 all lowercase, once he is in he can register, display registered, update and even delete registered student. If you try to enter a name like oriemi123 this will throw an exception, i've used regular expression so the so it only takes letters and space like wise for birth year and id number it only takes numbers or throw an exception.
 In this Java mini project a lot of java concepts have been used things like: encapsulation, inheritance
 polimorphisim, throw exceptions, try and catch and a lot of concepts.
